# Architecture and separation of concerns

## Runtime

The browser renders React components and calls relative `/api` URLs. During development Vite proxies those requests to ASP.NET Core on port 5180. PostgreSQL runs on port 55432. In production, a reverse proxy must serve the compiled portal and route `/api/*` to the API on the same public origin.

The API authenticates requests with protected cookies and checks workspace membership against PostgreSQL. UI visibility is not authorization. Files and opaque sharing tokens have separate database tables and permission checks.

## Frontend boundaries

- `src/portal/src/main.tsx`: mounts providers and global styles. It contains no workspace behavior.
- `src/portal/src/app/`: application shell, navigation, modal composition, and workspace orchestration.
- `src/portal/src/app/hooks/`: workspace loading/direct-link lifecycle and save coordination.
- `src/portal/src/features/`: cards, boards, projects, dashboards, help, workspaces, workflow, profile, notifications, and authentication views.
- `src/portal/src/domain/`: TypeScript models and card/project rules, independent of React, HTTP, and browser storage.
- `src/portal/src/infrastructure/`: HTTP, repository selection, sessions, attachment/sharing adapters, and account storage.
- `src/portal/src/infrastructure/local/`: browser-only workspace persistence and compatibility fixtures.
- `src/portal/src/shared/`: language and theme providers.
- `src/portal/src/styles/`: source CSS, explicit dark overrides, and generated dark CSS.

Views receive state and typed callbacks; the workspace shell coordinates changes affecting several features. Domain models do not import infrastructure. HTTP handling belongs to `apiClient`, and persistence belongs to the repository. Saves return canonical state rather than mutating React state objects. The `data.ts` barrel remains for compatibility with existing local browser checks; new source imports the owning module directly.

## Backend boundaries

The API is a deployable assembly with feature folders. The separate
`worker/Kanbada.Worker.csproj` process references it to share persistence and Jira
synchronization logic without running HTTP endpoints. The public namespace remains `Kanbada.Api`.

- `Program.cs`: configuration entry point, middleware order, route composition, startup migration.
- `Configuration/`: dependency injection and validated options.
- `Documentation/`: Scalar integration, generated OpenAPI metadata, and fictional example payloads.
- `Cards/`: typed card-creation command, service, and endpoint.
- `Security/` and `Errors/`: request-origin enforcement and centralized Problem Details.
- `Authentication/`: provider endpoints, password/session service, cookie validation.
- `Workspaces/`: workspace endpoints, transaction store, input validation, transport mapping, history generation, and EF metrics queries.
- `Persistence/`: EF Core context, explicit relational entities/configuration, and EF migrations.
- `Contracts/`: request records, initial workspace factory, JSON contract accessors.
- `Files/`, `Sharing/`, `Invitations/`: feature-specific transport and permission handling.
- `Health/`: PostgreSQL readiness check.
- `Jira/`: owner-authorized project settings, token protection, cron scheduling,
  Jira REST adapters and per-item synchronization. The worker polls PostgreSQL
  schedules and claims connections using session advisory locks.
- `tests/`: API integration tests with isolated database schemas.

Endpoint modules translate HTTP into feature operations. `WorkspaceStore` owns the atomic workspace transaction. Validators and history generation do not know about HTTP or database connections. `WorkspaceMapper` translates the transport contract into tracked entities; `KanbadaDbContext` owns persistence configuration. `WorkspaceResolver` resolves the personal-workspace alias. `WorkspaceMetrics` executes database-side aggregates.

File, invitation, and sharing modules use EF queries and permission checks. If these workflows grow or gain another transport, extract services/repositories alongside the feature rather than adding unrelated logic to `Program.cs` or `WorkspaceStore`.

## Save flow

1. A view edits a draft copied from the current workspace.
2. The shell invokes the save hook, which prevents simultaneous local writes and adds any notification.
3. The remote repository compares the draft with the exact loaded version, omits server-controlled history/identity fields, and sends only add/remove/replace changes using PATCH and `If-Match`.
4. The API opens a transaction, checks membership and the EF concurrency token, validates references and protected resources, regenerates history, reconciles membership and file references, then increments the version in one transaction.
5. The returned canonical delta updates a cloned frontend snapshot, including server-generated history and version. Failure leaves the existing state and draft available; a stale save is rejected instead of merged blindly.

## Deliberate tradeoffs

Workspace business data is normalized into related PostgreSQL tables managed by EF Core. The portal uses compact atomic PATCH requests and delta responses; PUT snapshots remain for compatibility. Concurrent edits share one workspace version and initial loads and changed refreshes still assemble the complete workspace; unchanged conditional GETs return 304 without loading collections; EF change tracking writes only changed rows. There is no server-side paging.

The portal polls for changes every 15 seconds while no card or modal is being edited; it does not use WebSockets. Dashboard PDF rendering, theme, language, sidebar collapse, and filter preferences belong to the browser. PostgreSQL stores business data and access control.

Before very large workspaces or high-volume multi-user editing, measure snapshot sizes and contention, then introduce additional granular commands, paging, and a push channel through the existing repository boundary.

## Reference guidance

The backend uses ASP.NET Core dependency injection, async I/O, pooled connections, centralized exception handling, cookie authentication, validated options, health checks, and OpenAPI. See [Microsoft's ASP.NET Core best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/best-practices?view=aspnetcore-10.0). The frontend follows immutable state and named component/hook boundaries described in [React's rules](https://react.dev/reference/rules).

These are engineering practices, not a claim of compliance with every Microsoft standard or a substitute for a production security/accessibility review.
